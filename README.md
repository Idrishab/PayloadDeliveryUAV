# Payload_Delivery_UAV
This project is an undergraduate aircraft design undertaken at Kwara State University in 2017. Initially started as a personal endeavor, it later evolved into a course project. The design process focused on manufacturability, with constraints shaped by personal funding and access to local workshops.

The UAV was designed with a maximum takeoff mass (MTOM) constraint of 1.2 kg. Design calculations and optimization were carried out using MATLAB scripts, while CAD modeling was performed in SolidWorks. Aerodynamic properties of various airfoils were analyzed using XFOIL to inform the final design choices.
